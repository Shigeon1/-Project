    <h2>AI in Education</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence is transforming learning for students and teachers. Tools like ChatGPT and adaptive learning platforms adjust to a student's needs in real-time, helping them master concepts at their own pace. AI also reduces teacher workload through grading automation and tutoring bots.</p>

    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Personalized learning, accessibility, instant feedback.<br>
    <strong>Cons:</strong> Dependence on tech, data privacy risks.</p>

  <section id="medicine">
    <h2>AI in Medicine</h2>
    <p>In healthcare, AI supports doctors with robotic surgeries, real-time patient data, and faster diagnostics. Systems like Da Vinci Surgical Robot improve precision and safety during procedures. AI also helps detect diseases like cancer earlier by analyzing medical images.</p>

    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> More accurate surgeries, faster diagnoses, better outcomes.<br>
    <strong>Cons:</strong> High cost, requires training, possible tech errors.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>While working on this project, we learned how powerful AI can be in both classrooms and hospitals. We were surprised by how fast the technology is improving. We also realized the importance of balancing innovation with ethicsâ€”especially in medicine. Through feedback, we improved our structure and added more visuals and examples to make it clearer. One question we now have is: how can we make AI more accessible to schools in low-income areas?</p>
